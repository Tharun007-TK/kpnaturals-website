# Supabase Integration Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up Supabase for product and review management in the KP Natural Oil Website.

## Prerequisites

- A Supabase account (https://supabase.com)
- Project environment variables configured in `.env.local`

## Step 1: Create Supabase Project

1. Go to https://supabase.com and create a new project
2. Wait for the project to be fully provisioned
3. Navigate to Project Settings > API
4. Copy your project URL and anon key

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Update your `.env.local` file with your Supabase credentials:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

## Step 3: Run Database Migration

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy the contents of `supabase-migration.sql`
4. Paste and run the SQL in the editor

This will:

- Create `products` and `reviews` tables
- Set up foreign key relationships
- Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Add indexes for performance
- Insert sample data (optional - you can remove these INSERT statements)

## Step 4: Verify Tables

In the Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to Table Editor
2. Verify that `products` and `reviews` tables exist
3. Check that sample data is present (if you included the INSERT statements)

## Database Schema

### Products Table

```
id          UUID (Primary Key)
name        TEXT (NOT NULL)

image_url   TEXT
created_at  TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
updated_at  TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
```

### Reviews Table

product_id  UUID (Foreign Key -> products.id)
user_name   TEXT (NOT NULL)
rating      INTEGER (1-5)

## Sample Product Data

You can manually add products through the admin panel or use this sample data in Supabase SQL Editor:

INSERT INTO products (name, description, price, image_url) VALUES
  (
    'KP Natural Hair Oil - Classic',
    'Our premium sulfur-free hair oil infused with hibiscus, coconut, and rosemary. Perfect for all hair types.',
    145.00,
    '/product1.png'

    'Extra strength formula for damaged and weak hair. Contains our secret herbal blend.',
    185.00,
    '/product2.png'
  );
```

## Troubleshooting
